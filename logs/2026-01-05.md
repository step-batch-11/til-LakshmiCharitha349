# Today I Learned

Write **1–3 concrete things** you understood better today.

- What _clicked_ today? I got clarity about random function and various types of
  randomness like uniform random, custom random, normal random.
- What changed in your understanding? I understood that we can also change the
  probability of random numbers based on our need.
- What would you explain differently now? In random every number has equal
  probability to be as a outcome but we can customise the numbers by taking an
  array of duplicate numbers or using percentages.

# Still Confusing

List **up to 3 things** that are still unclear.

- What almost makes sense but doesn’t fully? 3D noise
- What would you like to see one more example of? I want to see more real time
  examples on where 3D noise helps
- What feels fragile in your understanding? custom random distribution

# Questions to Chase

Write **2–5 questions** worth pursuing later.

Rules:

- Questions must be specific
- Avoid yes/no questions

- “How custom random distribution works . Where we use it?”
- "How transform stream works internally?"
-

# Tiny Experiments (Optional)

Small things you want to try tomorrow or later.

- A REPL experiment on readable and writable streams
